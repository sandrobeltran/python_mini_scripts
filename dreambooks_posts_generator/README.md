# Dreambooks Posts Generator

This minimal script allows create posts with the Dreambooks brand in some seconds! The reason of this script is help with the production timing, because the old way to do the posts was very tedious, and now is very easier and faster. While the old way spend hours, the new way spend just some minutes.

## Setup instructions

First of all, install the necessary dependencies with the following command:  

    pip install -r requirements.txt
Once you have done, just create a folder with the name "Posts" in the root folder.  
__Note: The name of the created folder must be exactly "Posts"__

## Run instructions

First of all, let's understand a bit the structure of the project:
- The "Covers 2.0" folder: Is the folder where the script will search the covers, download and put them here. (The variety of sizes is not a problem cause the script resizes them).
- The "Posts" folder: Is the folder where the script will store the ready posts.
- The "edit.py" file: Is the python script that makes all the functionality.
